- URL routing and views
- Template rendering
- Database models (upcoming)
- User authentication (upcoming)

## Technologies Used

- **Python** 3.11
- **Django** 5.2
- **SQLite** (database)

## Current Status

**In Progress** - Actively learning and building out features as I progress through the course.
